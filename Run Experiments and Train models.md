## Create a Pipeline using AzureML Designer
- in the home page of resources click on start now tab in Designer
- on designer page click on + button
- now our designer interface opens
- we have the canvas in the middle where we can drag and drop our modules
- we have the list of modules on the left side
- in the search box we can search any module
- now change the name of the pipeline to `loan automation`
- then below this we have a button  `show assets library` to hide and show the libray
- Now First get out data from data set 
- just drag and drop loan application dataset from asset group of dataset
      
- when we click on the dataset in canvas , we will see the parameter on the right side <br>
          - in the output we will see an icon and by clicking on it. we see the visualizations
- Now drag and drop select columns in dataset and made node between loan application dataset and select column in dataset box
- in properties now we will select columns by clicking on `edit column` <br>
           - On that screen we will choose edit by name <br>
           - then select the columns that we need by clicking the + sign <br>
           - select the dependent or target feature also <br>
- To remove the missing values in our dataset , search for `clean Missing data` and drag and drop it to our canvas to clean the missing data <br>
           - in properties click on edit column <br>
           - click on select columns by name, on which we want to perform the cleaning operations <br>
           - leave minimum missing value ratio and maximum missing value ratio to their default values <br>
           - in cleaning mode choose remove entire row <br>
- The next step is to split the data into train and test
- search for split data
- and drag and drop it on the canvas
- connect 1st output node on clean missing data to split data <br>
           - in properties on split data <br>
           - keep splitting mode as split rows, because we are going to split this dataset into rows <br>
           - keep fraction of rows in the first output dataset to 0.7, which means 70% record will be used to train dataset and 30% for test dataset <br>
           - leave randomized split as tick <br>
           - keep random seed as 123 <br>
           - put stratified split as True <br>
           - in stratified key column, click on edit column to select the column name for stratification basicall select the target column, in our case it is `Loan_Status` <br>
           - Click on save
           - Now we are ready to train our algorithm <br>
- To train the model we use two class logistic regression
- Search for two class logistic regression and drag and drop it on the canvas
- search for train model and drag and drop it on canvas
- connect one node from `Spilt Data output` to `train model input`
- also connect one node from output of `two class logistic regression` to input of `train model`
- click on logistic regression module to see the properties and in random seed provide value 123 and keep the rest values as it is
- click train model module to go to properties and in edit column select the target variable `Loan_status`
- click save it
- search for score model and drag and drop it in canvas
- now connect the output node of train model to one input node of score model
- and connect the output node of split data to second input node of score model
- now search for evaluate model and drag and drop it in canvas below the score model
- connect the output of score model to the 1st node of evaluate model
- thats it , we only have 1 model so only 1 connection from the score
- this completes our 1st pipeline in the designer
